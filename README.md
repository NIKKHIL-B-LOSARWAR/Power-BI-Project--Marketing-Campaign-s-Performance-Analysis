## Problem Statement

Consider the business scenario of a digital marketing agency that recently ran a digital ads 
campaign for one of its clients to perform marketing and positioning for their new product 
launch. You’re a business analyst who is working in that digital marketing agency. You’ve got 
the responsibility to find out how the marketing campaign is performing, by conducting the 
data analysis. To access how the digital campaign is going in the market, conduct a thorough 
Exploratory data analysis. For that, you have provided the dataset of the digital marketing 
campaign. Create a dashboard using the Microsoft Power BI tool, as a final output, and 
generate key insights by deploying it.
<br />

## Development Approach:

To access the performance of the digital Ads marketing campaign and communicate the key 
data insights along with a dashboard as a final output, I’ve performed the Exploratory Data 
Analysis approach by employing the Microsoft Power BI tool. I’ve performed all the key 
steps of data analysis here which are as below- 
1. Exploring the data and understating the Business context. 
2. Framing the Analytical goals to be implemented in the project. 
3. Importing the row dataset into the Power BI. 
4. Performing Data cleaning and transformations as per the requirement. 
5. Performing Data modeling on the transformed data tables. 
6. Introducing DAX Measures and DAX Columns as per the requirement in the analysis 
scope. 
7. Created Data Visualization charts to implement the analytical goals. 
8. Consolidated and organized all the visualization charts, buttons, and slicers into a 
single Dashboard. 
9. By deploying the Dashboard uncovered key data insights.

❖ What age group of customers are the high potential customers based on the past 
purchase records? 
Ans: 
Customers belonging to the ‘Adult’ age group, the age range of 25 to 45 years had the 
highest purchase records in the past. 


❖ Which gender of the customers buy more through the influence of campaign ads? 
Ans: 
Based on the past purchase analysis we can conclude that female customers buy 
impulsively. 


❖ What is the conversion % for individual channels? 
Ans: 
Conversion % for Channel-

Channel with Highest Avg. CTR%, in every age group- 
- Young (Below 25) = PPC (16.2%) 
- Adult (25 to 45) = PPC (15.9%) 
- Senior Adult (45 to 60) = Social Media (16%) 
- Old (Above 60) = Email (17%)



## Business Recommendation 

1. The lowest conversion rate from the Social Media channel indicates underutilized 
digital reach that is possible on a massive scale. To cater to this inefficiency, plan to 
position new product launches through the influencer marketing and content 
creation for product awareness and hype.

2. Data shows females buy impulsively as compared to male customers, also our 
around 60% customer base is female. Hence, strategic pricing for female customers 
can potentially boost sales of the product launch, like special discounted prices, 
providing coupons, etc.

3. Insights shows that there are around 5,400 customers out of 8,000 belonging to the 
Adults (aged 25 to 45) and the Senior Adults (aged 45 to 60) age groups, also these 
age group categories are the top 2 in the past purchases records and showing 
higher social media engagement. 
To capture this significant customer segment there is needed strategic positioning of 
new launches with premium brand value and quality service.

4. Analysis reveals that SEO and Social media have the least budget spend, and on the 
other hand PPC and Referral channels consume higher ad budget spend. 
To grow the sales and revenue organically it’s recommended that we have to spend 
more on SEO and Social media channels compared to others.
